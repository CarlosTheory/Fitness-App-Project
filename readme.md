# About 

Hi! Fitness-App-Project is a little app that I build as an assigment in College, the concept was pretty simple, just an app to add posts about exercises and nutrition, by time I decided to add it some more stuff, but still is under development.

This App is hybrid and was made using Ionic
For Back-end I just Laravel to build an API Rest

Here are both, app client and backend.

#Laravel
Just fork or clone the app, go to /app-backend and make

```bash
composer install
```

after, remeber to stablish your .env file, set-up your db and make

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

and then

```bash
php artisan passport:install
```
then, just run the server with

```bash
php artisan serve
```

#Ionic

Install modules with

```bash
npm install
```
